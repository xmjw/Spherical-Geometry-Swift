# Spherical Geometry Swift

This is basd on (spherical-geometry-js)[https://github.com/NotWoods/spherical-geometry-js].

A Swift Library for computing cartesian coordinates and spherical coordinates interchangably. The maths to actually do this is a little over my head (or so it seems from some horribly failed 3D renders...) so I'm going to port the existing maths.

## To Do:

- [x] LatLng protocol
- [ ] Compute Area
- [x] Compute Distance Between
- [ ] Compute Heading
- [ ] Compute Length
- [ ] Compute Offset
- [ ] Compute Signed Area
- [ ] Interpolation
- [ ] Analyse bounding areas
- [x] Radians / Degrees helpers

This is going to take me a while........
